A Minecraft 1.18.2+ mod designed to create an early game survival concept for immersion into various mods. Enforces correct tool to be used for breaking blocks, so no tree punching!

# Overview
Early game is pretty much non-existent in Minecraft. Punch a tree, craft a few items, done! This mod creates a very early game (first few nights) progression and changes the mechanic for getting wood and planks.

**NOTE**: Originally designed as an immersion mod for Tinkers' Construct, this is all of the core mechanic features for Tinkers' Survival in a separate mod to allow for building on new versions of Minecraft quickly, and allow other mod or modpack integration.

## Differences From Other [Insert Anti-Tree Punching Mod Here]
 * A proper harvest tool must be used. Which works correctly, and is configurable!
 * Can work with either a blacklist (default) or whitelist to enable/disable specific tools or armor from other mods. By default, allows all mods.
 * Doesn't try to do too much for early game, really guiding the user to proper tool usage.
 * Does not conflict with major mods
 * Modpack friendly

## Major Features
 * The only way to make wood planks is with a saw.
 * Crude tools are necessary to progress to initial tools, as they are the only way to obtain wood!
